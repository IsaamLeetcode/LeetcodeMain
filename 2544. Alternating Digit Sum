You are given a positive integer n. Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:

The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 521
Output: 4
Explanation: (+5) + (-2) + (+1) = 4.

Example 2:
Input: n = 111
Output: 1
Explanation: (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.

Example 3:
Input: n = 886996
Output: 0
Explanation: (+8) + (-8) + (+6) + (-9) + (+9) + (-6) = 0.

class Solution:
    def alternateDigitSum(self, n: int) -> int:
        odd = []
        even = []
        numStr = str(n)
        currentIndex = 0 
        #Loop through the number, sort the odd and even indices, and add/subtract as needed.
        for digitStr in numStr:
            digit = int(digitStr)
            if currentIndex % 2 == 0:
                odd.append(digit)
            else:
                even.append(digit)
            currentIndex += 1
        oddSum = sum(odd)
        for neg in even:
            oddSum -= neg
        return oddSum
