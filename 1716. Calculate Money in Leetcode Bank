Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

Example 3:
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.

class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        #Initialise values for the week day, and balance.
        week = 0
        day = 1
        final = 0
        #Loop through the number of days, increase the final by the amount added for each week 
        #and day, increment the value for day.
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            final = final + (week + day)
            day += 1
            #If we reach an multiple of 7, we have started a new week, and must increment the 
            #week and reset the day.
            if i % 7 == 0:
                week += 1
                day = 1
        return final
